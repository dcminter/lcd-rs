# Todo list for this project

Could happen in any old order...

  * Better documentation of the hardware
  * Better documentation of the Python script
  * Get the basics of the Rust script working
    * Initialy sleep-based like the Python script
    * Then based off of the Busy line (which is the same as the RS/Register-Select line)
    * Possibly edge-detection or interrupt driven?
